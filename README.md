# SOLARM â€“ Smart Irrigation & Motion Detection System

## Overview
**SOLARM** is an ESP8266-based smart irrigation and security system integrated with the **Blynk app**.  
It monitors soil moisture, controls a relay for watering, detects motion with a PIR sensor, and activates a buzzer and continuous rotation servo as a response to motion. The system is fully controllable and monitored remotely via Blynk.

## Features
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring:**  
  Reads soil moisture from an analog sensor (A0) and displays it on the Blynk app in real-time.  
- **Automatic Watering:**  
  Controls a relay to turn on a water pump when soil moisture drops below 41%.  
- **Motion Detection:**  
  Detects motion with a PIR sensor and triggers a buzzer and servo motor.  
- **Blynk Integration:**  
  - Real-time sensor updates (soil moisture, motion detection)  
  - Remote relay control  
  - Notifications through virtual pins for watering, motion, and servo activation  
- **Servo Motor Control:**  
  Continuous rotation servo rotates in both directions upon motion detection.  
- **Non-blocking Operation:**  
  Uses timed intervals to read sensors and handle events without blocking other tasks.
